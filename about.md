Hello World!

My name is Lisa and I'm a developer in Germany; I am working for INNOQ.

I've worked with Java, JavaScript, Python and other languages. I have some experience with Kubernetes and Docker. Of course I love learning more about any topic, which jumps into my way.

### More Information

Besides programming, I like to knit, to draw and to watch some movies and series on Netflix.
