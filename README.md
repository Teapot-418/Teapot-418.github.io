# GitHub Pages / teapot418.de

This repository contains everything for running my blog.  
This repository is forked from: [Barry Clarks Repo](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now.git).

# Jekyll Now

**Jekyll** is a static site generator that's perfect for GitHub hosted blogs ([Jekyll Repository](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll))  
**Jekyll Now** makes it easier to create your Jekyll blog, by eliminating a lot of the up front setup.

# Local Development
1. Install Jekyll and plug-ins in one fell swoop. `gem install github-pages` This mirrors the plug-ins used by GitHub Pages on your local machine including Jekyll, Sass, etc.
2. Clone down your fork `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourusername.github.io.git`
3. Serve the site and watch for markup/sass changes `jekyll serve` or `jekyll serve --future` if upcoming blog-posts should be visible.
4. View your website at http://127.0.0.1:4000/ or http://localhost:4000/
5. Commit any changes and push everything to the master branch of your GitHub user repository. GitHub Pages will then rebuild and serve your website.

# Pushing into production

Simply commit something into the master-branch and the new GitHub-pages will be generated.
